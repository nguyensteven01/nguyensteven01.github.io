Hello, my name is Steven Nguyen and I am currently a PhD student at UC San Diego (UCSD) studying topics in control theory like data-driven methods, reachability, and control for design optimization of aircraft.....

I come from the Bay Area in California and received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UC Santa Barbara (UCSB). While I was an undergraduate student at UCSB, I explored research in the fields of fluid dynamics and materials science before discovering my interest in the study of dynamics and control. As a theoretically-inclined student, the rigorous mathematical formulations and solutions of engineering problems caught my attention immediately. This interest led me to pursue undergraduate research with Professor Igor Mezic, where I studied monomial observables for Koopman operator theory.

Outside of research, I play trombone with La Jolla Symphony and the Finest City Winds/Brass ensembles. I also like to play ultimate frisbee and frequently play in various leagues around San Diego. Lastly, I enjoy going to theaters in my free time and watch plenty of movies (follow me on [Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/1irUV)).
