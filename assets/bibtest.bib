abstract = {Summary This chapter describes how the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an aircraft are created, how they are modeled mathematically, and how the data for the models are gathered. These forces and moments are related to the equations of motion of a rigid aircraft. The transformation of the equations of motion into a different set of coordinates is demonstrated and also the derivation of a nonlinear model for longitudinal motion only. Steady-state flight conditions are defined. It is shown that the equations of motion can be linearized around a steady-state condition and that they can then be separated into two decoupled sets. One of these sets describes the longitudinal motion of an aircraft, and the other describes the lateral-directional motion. The linear equations are expressed in terms of the aerodynamic derivatives, and the significance of these derivatives are explained.}

It serves as an introduction for (advanced) undergraduates or Master's and PhD students in economics, statistics, mathematics, and engineering, who want to know how to apply matrix calculus without going into all the theoretical details. The chapter begins by introducing the concept of a differential, which lies at the heart of matrix calculus. Next, it discusses vector calculus and optimization, with and without constraints. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of a correct definition and notation for the derivative, presents the â€˜first identification theorem', which links the first differential with the first derivative, and applies these results to least squares. Then, it extends the theory from vector calculus to matrix calculus and obtains the differentials of the determinant and inverse. Finally, the chapter introduces the vec operator and the Kronecker product, and discusses symmetry (commutation and duplication matrices).}

CORA is a toolbox that integrates various vector and matrix set representations and operations on them as well as reachability algorithms of various dynamic system classes. The software is designed such that set representations can be exchanged without having to modify the code for reachability analysis. CORA has a modular design, making it possible to use the capabilities of the various set representations for other purposes besides reachability analysis. The toolbox is designed using the object oriented paradigm, such that users can safely use methods without concerning themselves with detailed information hidden inside the object. Since the toolbox is written in MATLAB, the installation and use is platform independent.},

It is a fundamental problem motivated by many applications in formal verification, controller synthesis, and estimation, to name only a few. This article focuses on a class of methods for computing a guaranteed overapproximation of the reachable set of continuous and hybrid systems, relying predominantly on set propagation; starting from the set of initial states, these techniques iteratively propagate a sequence of sets according to the system dynamics. After a review of set representation and computation, the article presents the state of the art of set propagation techniques for reachability analysis of linear, nonlinear, and hybrid systems. It ends with a discussion of successful applications of reachability analysis to real-world problems.},

  abstract = {The push for cleaner aviation to meet the net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal will require introducing innovative technologies in future aircraft. Active control is a key enabler of these technologies. For example, actively reducing gust and maneuver loads allows the design of lighter and higher-aspect-ratio wings that reduce fuel burn. Traditionally, airframe and controller design are done sequentially. However, due to the couplings between these disciplines, this approach cannot guarantee that the final design is optimal on a system level. Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) offers a solution by simultaneously considering all disciplines and their cross-couplings. However, doing a detailed controller design early in the design cycle may still be undesirable due to the additional complexity brought into the MDO process, the fact that many state-of-the-art control design techniques are not suitable for inclusion in gradient-based optimization, and the presence of uncertainties about the final control architecture. Thus, approaches that introduce meaningful control-related constraints for airframe design without controller co-design are of interest. This work develops a method to estimate the performance of the closed-loop system, without controller design, based on parameterizing and designing the sensitivity transfer function of the closed-loop system. This approach efficiently approximates the best achievable closed-loop performance under stochastic disturbances, quantified by a class of risk metrics based on the power spectral density of signals in the system. It also enforces a technological limit on the bandwidth of the closed-loop system via a constraint on the Bode sensitivity integral relation. Analytical formulas for the derivatives of these metrics are derived in direct and adjoint modes and verified against finite difference approximations. These formulas allow fast and accurate derivative calculation, enabling the inclusion of the proposed metrics in gradient-based optimization problems. This approach is demonstrated in the MDO design of the wingbox of an aircraft with a gust load alleviation (GLA) system including a fatigue constraint, and in the analysis of the glideslope tracking performance of a supersonic configuration aircraft on the approach to land phase of flight, considering constraints on the risk of glideslope deviation, stall, and saturation of the elevator. The inclusion of maneuver load alleviation (MLA) in the design is considered through a strategy that is minimally intrusive to a pre-existing MDO problem. This strategy relies on a nested (bi-level) optimization approach and includes a model order reduction process to improve computational performance. It is demonstrated in the aerostructural design of a cantilevered wing, which includes a flutter constraint. The implementation of these methods in aeroelastic and MDO software is discussed, emphasizing the efficient use of algorithmic differentiation (AD). This enables the definition of new metrics without direct interaction with the AD tool, saving programming effort.},

  abstract = {The control of complex non-linear systems can be aided by modeling each system as a collection of simplified hybrid modes, with each mode representing a particular operating regime defined by the system dynamics or by a region of the state space in which the system operates. Guarantees on the safety and performance of such hybrid systems can still be challenging to generate, however. Reachability analysis using a dynamic game formulation with Hamilton---Jacobi methods provides a useful way to generate these types of guarantees, and the technique is flexible enough to analyze a wide variety of systems. This paper presents two applications of reachable sets, both focused on guaranteeing the safety and performance of robotic aerial vehicles. In the first example, reachable sets are used to design and implement a backflip maneuver for a quadrotor helicopter. In the second, reachability analysis is used to design a decentralized collision avoidance algorithm for multiple quadrotors. The theory for both examples is explained, and successful experimental results are presented from flight tests on the STARMAC quadrotor helicopter platform.},

  abstract = {This paper sets forth a method for reachability analysis of linear dynamic systems in continuous time that can be used to compute time-domain bounds of states and outputs with floating-point precision. The focus is on the particular initial conditions and inputs that cause state or output trajectories to attain their extreme values in time. Inputs can be constant, arbitrary, or Lipschitz continuous waveforms. Uncertainties in initial conditions and inputs are modeled using zonotopes. The calculations exploit the definition of zonotopes and the modal information of the linear system dynamics.},
